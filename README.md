# Mpesa Integration Project

This project implements Mpesa integration with two main components:
- STK Push
- Payhere

## STK Push

The STK Push feature allows users to initiate Mpesa payments directly from their phones.

## Successful Transaction

When a transaction is completed successfully, users will see a confirmation screen.
